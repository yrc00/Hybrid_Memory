## ℹ️ Overview
We introduce **LocAgent**, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation.
By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures and their dependencies, enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning.

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:gersteinlab/LocAgent.git
   cd LocAgent

   conda create -n locagent python=3.12
   conda activate locagent
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Launch LocAgent
1. (Optional but recommended) Parse the codebase for each issue in the benchmark to generate graph indexes in batch.
   ```
   python dependency_graph/batch_build_graph.py \
         --dataset 'czlll/Loc-Bench_V1' \
         --split 'test' \
         --num_processes 50 \
         --download_repo
   ```
   - `dataset`: select the benchmark (by default it will be `SWE-Bench_Lite`); you can choose from `['czlll/SWE-bench_Lite', 'czlll/Loc-Bench_V1']`(adapted for code localization) and SWE-bench series datasets like `['princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite', 'princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified', 'princeton-nlp/SWE-bench']`
   - `repo_path`: the directory where you plan to pull or have already pulled the codebase
   - `index_dir`: the base directory where the generated graph index will be saved
   - `download_repo`: whether to download the codebase to `repo_path` before indexing

2. Export the directory of the graph indexes and the BM25 sparse index. If not generated in advance, the graph index will be generated during the localization process.
   ```
   export GRAPH_INDEX_DIR='{INDEX_DIR}/{DATASET_NAME}/graph_index_v2.3'
   export BM25_INDEX_DIR='{INDEX_DIR}/{DATASET_NAME}/BM25_index'
   ```

2. Run the script `scripts/run_lite.sh` to lauch LocAgent.
   ```
   python auto_search_main.py \
      --dataset 'czlll/SWE-bench_Lite' \
      --split 'test' \
      --model 'azure/gpt-4o' \
      --localize \
      --merge \
      --output_folder $result_path/location \
      --eval_n_limit 300 \
      --num_processes 50 \
      --use_function_calling \
      --simple_desc
   ```
   - `localize`: set to start the localization process
   - `merge`: merge the result of multiple samples
   - `use_function_calling`: enable function calling features of LLMs. If disabled, codeact will be used to support function calling
   -  `simple_desc`: use simplified function descriptions due to certain LLM limitations. Set to False for better performance when using Claude.

3. Evaluation
   After localization, the results will be saved in a JSONL file. You can evaluate them using `evaluation.eval_metric.evaluate_results`. Refer to `evaluation/run_evaluation.ipynb` for a demonstration.

    abstract = "Code localization{--}identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made{--}is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code snippets.The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the target code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies.We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through a graph-guided agent.By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures and their dependencies, enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning.Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization.Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86{\%} reduction), reaching up to 92.7{\%} accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12{\%} for multiple attempts (Pass@10).
